### River Discharge

**River discharge climatology**

The river discharge is the volume of water flowing through a river channel, measured at any given point in cubic metres per second (m³/s) as the product of the mean streamflow velocity (m/s) and the cros-sectional area (m^2). The long term mean from 2010–2021, namely the climatology, is here mapped on the GloFAS river network over south-eastern Ghana. This map shows a downstream increase in the color intensity along the Volta river, representing a growing mean discharge as one gets closer to the coast. The colorbar shows a correspondence between the increasing intensity of blue color and the increase in average streamflow values: for instance, dark blue indicates high discharge (with a mean maximum of 1870.94 m³/s), whereas the pale blue is associated with low streamflow values (up to a mean minimum of 0.006 m³/s). Reflecting the Volta river morphology, the river discharge climatology has a spatial distribution with the highest values in the segment closest to the coast, while the lowest values occur further north, in the upstream tributaries. This is coherent with the river-network topology and the increase in contributing area toward the mouth as the land area that drains water to the river keeps getting bigger because more tributaries have joined. Whereby upstream inflows accumulate along the main stem so mean discharge rises downstream, while headwater tributaries carry lower climatological flows and greater intermittency.

**River discharge time series**

The daily river discharge stored in the GloFAS dataset represent the streamflow measured within 24 hours prior to the reference date. The daily time series, for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2021, is computed for the two reference points: the Volta Lake point, representative of the regulated outflow just downstream of Lake Volta (Akosombo area); and the Volta Estuary point, which represents the discharge reaching the Volta Delta. 

The top time series show the diacharge at the Volta River mouth. It ranges from a baseflow of about 600 m³/s to peaks up to 16974 m³/s, with a trend that, in its form, seems to repeat itself for each year: low values in the first months, with few or no peaks above the baseflow, and then one sharp peak in the second half of the year, for almost every year. The highest crest was recorded in 2018, with other very high years in 2019, 2020, 2010. The bottom graph represents the same time series just downstream of Lake Volta. It can be noted the difference in the magnitude of river discharge values: in this case the range of values goes from nearly zero to ~20 m³/s, with a 3 order of magnitude of difference with respect to the downstream other reference point. Moreover, the streamflow in this part of the Volta River presents few very spiky and flashy relatively high spikes, with many short peaks. The higher values are clustered in the same seasons as the mouth peaks and, generally, the time distribution approximately replicates the same shape of the discharge at the estuary, even if slightly skewed to the left (meaning that the high streamflow values are anticipated at the Volta Lake with respect to the delta region). The bursts appear around 2010 and 2019, followed by 2014, 2012, and 2017.
