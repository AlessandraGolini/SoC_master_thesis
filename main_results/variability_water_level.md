### Water Level

**Water level time series**

The “Maximum Daily Global Open Ocean Water Level” dataset used in this analysis provides a daily time series of offshore maximum water level. The key variable is an open-ocean daily maximum water level signal, whose originary units are 10⁻⁴ m, then converted in m by multiplying by 1e-4. Here, the raw time series of this variable are shown. In particular, the figure shows daily (blue) and corresponding monthly mean (red) water level in meters, at the reference point in the Volta Delta (0.667°E, 5.77°N), near Ada Foah, Ghana. The dataset spans January 2010 through December 2021. The overall water levels fluctuate around 0.03-0.07m, and it is characterized by a daily high-frequency variability, while the monthly average captures the main oscillations and removes high-frequency noise, as an effect of the increased timescale. In particular, daily record contains considerable sub-monthly variance, manifesting as sharp positive and negative excursions around the monthly mean. 
As the dataset is constructed (that is, through satellite altimetry that measures the geophysical sea level anomaly with respect to a reference surface and therefore without the astronomical component), this high sub-seasonal variability of water level may be due to other transient atmospheric and oceanographic forcing.

Moreover, the signal presents a dominant annual cycle, with a seasonal rise and fall in water level: peaks occur twice per year, typically in boreal winter and during early autumn, whereas minima occur in boreal summer. The amplitude of seasonal maxima, however, is not stationary, since their height is far from constant from year to year. In fact, in 2011 and 2019 the daily maxima exceed 0.10-0.12m, while in 2012-2018 they are closer to 0.06-0.08m. 

Over the 12-year record, no systematic trend in mean sea level is detectable. The absence of a clear rising trend is not necessarily inconsistent with global sea-level rise, as the short duration and dominance of interannual variability can mask secular trends. Furthermore, the relative (or local) sea level, that accounts for the changes in sea level experienced at a specific location, depends not only on the global climate-induced sea level rise trend, but also on the eustatic behaviour of the land. Thus, relative sea level change can vary significantly from place to place, even if the global absolute sea level is rising.
