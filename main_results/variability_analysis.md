### River Discharge

**River discharge climatology**

The river discharge is the volume of water flowing through a river channel, measured at any given point in cubic metres per second (m³/s) as the product of the mean streamflow velocity (m/s) and the cros-sectional area (m^2). The long term mean from 2010–2021, namely the climatology, is here mapped on the GloFAS river network over south-eastern Ghana. This map shows a downstream increase in the color intensity along the Volta river, representing a growing mean discharge as one gets closer to the coast. The colorbar shows a correspondence between the increasing intensity of blue color and the increase in average streamflow values: for instance, dark blue indicates high discharge (with a mean maximum of 1870.94 m³/s), whereas the pale blue is associated with low streamflow values (up to a mean minimum of 0.006 m³/s). Reflecting the Volta river morphology, the river discharge climatology has a spatial distribution with the highest values in the segment closest to the coast, while the lowest values occur further north, in the upstream tributaries. This is coherent with the river-network topology and the increase in contributing area toward the mouth as the land area that drains water to the river keeps getting bigger because more tributaries have joined. Whereby upstream inflows accumulate along the main stem so mean discharge rises downstream, while headwater tributaries carry lower climatological flows and greater intermittency.

**River discharge time series**

The daily river discharge variable stored in the GloFAS dataset represents the streamflow measured within 24 hours prior to the reference date. Its daily time series, for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2021, is computed for the two reference points: in the Akosombo area, just downstream of Lake Volta; and in the Volta Delta, near Ada Foah, in correspondence of the mouth of the river. 

The top time series show the discharge at the Volta river mouth. It ranges from a baseflow of about 600 m³/s up to 16974 m³/s, and it exibits a strong seasonality with distint highpeaks roughly once per year. The highest crest was recorded in 2018, with other very high years in 2019, 2020, 2010. Between peaks, discharge remains very low (below 1000 m³/s) during the first months, showing a sharp rise and fall in the second part of the year, for almost every year. The bottom graph shows the daily discharge just downstream of Lake Volta, the largest artificial lake by area in the world, regulated by the Akosombo Dam. The river discharge near Akosombo behaves similarly to the delta reference point, with a clear seasonality that highlights annual peaks that reaches a maximum of 16620 m³/s in 2018 and a baseflow slightly higher than the one measured at the delta. This smoother shape could be explined by the proximity to the dam, whose operations smooth out flows.

Both sites show strong annual cycles, that could be linked either to precipitation distribution in the Volta Basin, or to the management of the Akosombo Dam. The proximity to the dam itself, for instance, makes the hydrograph slightly dampened downstrem of Volta Lake, maintaining a more sustained discharge and therefore reflecting reservoir regulation. The dam releases, in fact, can explain why flows remain above zero even in dry periods. On the other hand, the mouth seems slightly more sensitive to natural variability, with sharper contrasts between flood and dry events. Neither of these timeseries exibit a clear and visible long-term upward or downward trendin discharge, which makes sense because the flow regulation depends on the management of the artificial lake at the north of Akosombo, but also because precipitation is a highly noisy variable, especially at the Tropics.
