### Water Level

**Water level time series**

The “Maximum Daily Global Open Ocean Water Level” dataset used in this analysis provides a daily time series of offshore maximum water level. The key variable is an open-ocean daily maximum water level signal, whose originary units are 10⁻⁴ m, then converted in m by multiplying by 1e-4. Here, the raw time series of this variable are shown. In particular, the figure shows daily (blue) and corresponding monthly mean (red) water level in meters, at the reference point in the Volta Delta (0.667°E, 5.77°N), near Ada Foah, Ghana. The dataset spans January 2010 through December 2021. The overall water levels fluctuate around 0.03-0.07m, and it is characterized by a daily high-frequency variability, while the monthly average captures the main oscillations and removes high-frequency noise, as an effect of the increased timescale. In particular, daily record contains considerable sub-monthly variance, manifesting as sharp positive and negative excursions around the monthly mean. 
As the dataset is constructed (that is, through satellite altimetry that measures the geophysical sea level anomaly with respect to a reference surface and therefore without the astronomical component), this high sub-seasonal variability of water level may be due to other transient atmospheric and oceanographic forcing.

Moreover, the signal presents a dominant annual cycle, with a seasonal rise and fall in water level: peaks occur twice per year, typically in boreal winter and during early autumn, whereas minima occur in boreal summer. The amplitude of seasonal maxima, however, is not stationary, since their height is far from constant from year to year. In fact, in 2011 and 2019 the daily maxima exceed 0.10-0.12m, while in 2012-2018 they are closer to 0.06-0.08m. 

Over the 12-year record, no systematic trend in mean sea level is detectable. The absence of a clear rising trend is not necessarily inconsistent with global sea-level rise, as the short duration and dominance of interannual variability can mask secular trends. Furthermore, the relative (or local) sea level, that accounts for the changes in sea level experienced at a specific location, depends not only on the global climate-induced sea level rise trend, but also on the eustatic behaviour of the land. Thus, relative sea level change can vary significantly from place to place, even if the global absolute sea level is rising.

**Water Level Climatology**

To better understand the climatological seasonal cycle of sea water level at the Volta river estuary, it is convenient to remove any long-term trend from the signal. Taking the detrended long-term mean of daily water level (blue curve), as well as the monthly detrended mean climatology (red curve) over the period 2010-2021, it becomes even clearer the annual periodicity that this signal exhibits. This seasonal cycle is characterized by maximum values of water levels between February and March, with the highest daily climatology value corresponding to +0.022m on March 19. Levels then decrease steadily through April–July, reaching minimum values in July–August (about –0.025 m on August 4). A recovery phase follows in September–November, with a secondary high plateau (~0 to +0.01 m). Levels decline slightly in December, returning toward neutral values.

Therefore, the water level in the estuarine region of the Volta river, in the Keta Basin (Ghana), shows a variability rango of approximatively 0.03-0.04m. this amplitude is consistent with a climatic signal, not simply noise, and indicates that the estuary is strongly modulated by seasonal oceanographic/atmospheric forcing.

Lastly, the daily climatology (blue) shows considerable intra-month variability, reflecting day-to-day meteorological forcing and high-frequency processes. On the other hand, the monthly mean climatology (red) smooths out these fluctuations and highlights the seasonal structure: one strong annual maximum (in late boreal winter/early spring), a pronounced minimum (boreal summer), and a smaller secondary peak (autumn). The occurrence of water level relative maxima twice a year suggests a semi-annual cycle, coherently with what emerges from the literature (Ghomsi et al., 2024 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55170-x; Polo et al., 2008 https://doi.org/10.1029/2007jc004495; Richter et al., 2022 https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL095918).

These fluctuations are representative of seasonal synoptic-scale atmospheric forcing (such as wind surges, pressure anomalies, and tropical weather systems) trat influence the ocean dynamic in the Gulf of Guinea. For example, the boreal summer is characterized by strengthened southwesterly monsoon winds that induce upwelling. This process shoals the thermocline and brings cold, dense subsurface waters to the surface, thereby lowering the local sea surface height (Verstraete, 1992 https://doi.org/10.1016/0079-6611(92)90002-H). The seasonal cycle is further modulated by the propagation of equatorial Kelvin waves and subsequent coastal trapped waves, which can reinforce or oppose the wind-driven signal depending on their phase (Ghomsi et al., 2024).

**Water Level Anomaly**

Beyond the seasonal cycle, which remains the dominant and recurring pattern from year to year, the sea level observed at the coast of the Keta Basin also exhibits marked interannual variability. This variability can significantly modulate the amplitude of seasonal extremes, with certain years characterized by unusually strong maxima and minima compared to the long-term average. Such behavior is well captured by the water-level anomalies, here computed by detrending the original signal and subtracting the corresponding detrended climatology. These anomalies therefore isolate the interannual and higher-frequency fluctuations from the long-term seasonal cycle, highlighting the role of large-scale climate modes and regional ocean–atmosphere interactions in shaping local sea-level variability. The figure shows detrended daily anomalies (red) and their corresponding monthly means (blue) for offshore water level at the Volta Estuary between 2010 and 2021. As for the daily anomaly values, they exhibit large variability ranging from -0.06m to +0.07m, with frequent sharp peaks and troughs. As one could expect, the monthly mean anomaly curve smooths out this high-frequency noise, emphasizing interannual variability with amplitude typically between –0.02 m and +0.04 m. In both cases, several noticeable periods of sustained anomalies emerge. The series starts with monthly anomalies slightly but consistently negative during all 2010, whereas daily departures from the mean that oscillate around the zero with positive peaks. In contrast, 2011 was characterized by persistent positive anomalies, with monthly anomalies consistently higher than +0.02m, and multiple daily peaks exceeding +0.05 m. Thereafter, the water level oscillated around the long-term mean value, with more neutral anomalies. By contrast, from mid 2014 to end 2016 water levels reached pronounced negative anomalies (<–0.02 m), with daily minima near and beyond –0.04 m. In the following years, between 2017 and late 2018, the anomalies went back closer to neutral with weak oscillations around the mean value, whereas during 2019 another episode of strong positive anomalies occurred, again exceeding +0.02–0.03m on a monthly scale. Finally, anomalies went again closer to neutral, ending with monthly negative values during 2021.

It is clear, from this representation of anomaly values, that daily water levels at the Ghanain coast tend to fluctuate over long-term mean values with high frequency. These daily sharp spikes around the slower-varying monthly baseline could be explained by the influence of synoptic-scale atmospheric variability (winds, pressure anomalies, storms) on the sea water level, and they are critical for extreme sea-level and flooding events. 

On the other hand, the interannual variability that emerges from the slower-varying monthly anomalies could be linked to broader and slower climate modes, such as the Atlantic Niño/Atlantic Equatorial Mode that influence the sea surface temperatures and upwelling variability in the Gulf of Guinea (Tokinaga & Xie, 2011 https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1078), or even basin-wide teleconnections such as ENSO, which can modulate Atlantic trade winds and impact coastal sea levels during strong events (Janicot et al., 2011; IPCC AR6, Chapter 9).
