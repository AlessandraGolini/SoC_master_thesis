### River Discharge

**River discharge climatology**

The river discharge is the volume of water flowing through a river channel, measured at any given point in cubic metres per second (m³/s) as the product of the mean streamflow velocity (m/s) and the cros-sectional area (m^2). The long term mean from 2010–2021, namely the climatology, is here mapped on the GloFAS river network over south-eastern Ghana. This map shows a downstream increase in the color intensity along the Volta river, representing a growing mean discharge as one gets closer to the coast. The colorbar shows a correspondence between the increasing intensity of blue color and the increase in average streamflow values: for instance, dark blue indicates high discharge (with a mean maximum of 1870.94 m³/s), whereas the pale blue is associated with low streamflow values (up to a mean minimum of 0.006 m³/s). Reflecting the Volta river morphology, the river discharge climatology has a spatial distribution with the highest values in the segment closest to the coast, while the lowest values occur further north, in the upstream tributaries. This is coherent with the river-network topology and the increase in contributing area toward the mouth as the land area that drains water to the river keeps getting bigger because more tributaries have joined. Whereby upstream inflows accumulate along the main stem so mean discharge rises downstream, while headwater tributaries carry lower climatological flows and greater intermittency.

**River discharge time series**

The daily river discharge variable stored in the GloFAS dataset represents the streamflow measured within 24 hours prior to the reference date. Its daily time series, for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2021, is computed for the two reference points: in the Akosombo area, just downstream of Lake Volta; and in the Volta Delta, near Ada Foah, in correspondence of the mouth of the river. 

The top time series show the discharge at the Volta river mouth. It ranges from a baseflow of about 600 m³/s up to 16974 m³/s, and it exibits a strong seasonality with distint highpeaks roughly once per year. The highest crest was recorded in 2018, with other very high values in 2019, 2020, 2010. Between peaks, discharge remains very low during the first months of the year, showing a sharp rise and fall in the second half of the year, for almost every year. The bottom graph shows the daily discharge just downstream of Lake Volta, the largest artificial lake by area in the world, regulated by the Akosombo Dam. The river discharge near Akosombo behaves similarly to the delta reference point, with a clear seasonality that highlights annual peaks which reach a maximum of 16620 m³/s in 2018, and a baseflow similar to the one measured at the delta. In this location, the hydrograph seems to present a smoother shape, with less natural variability with respect to the estuarine region and smoother contrasts between flood and dry events. Lastly, teither of these timeseries exibit a clear and visible long-term upward or downward trendin discharge.

Hence, the temporal distributions of river discharge at these two different locations present several similarities. For instance, the strong annual cycles that both series show could be linked either to the precipitation distribution in the basin, and to the influence of the reservoir created by the Akosombo Dam, which regulates the flow downstream the dam to the coast. The annual peaks in discharge likely reflect the seasonal migration of precipitation over West Africa, following the seasonal shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the dynamics of the West African Monsoon system. In this region, in fact, major intense rainfall events appear near to the Gulf of Guinea from April to June, move to higher latitudes (of about 10°N) during the boreal summer months, and then retreat back to the south after mid-September October (Gu & Adler (2004) [https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017<3364:SEAVAW>2.0.CO;2](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017%3C3364:SEAVAW%3E2.0.CO;2), Sultan and Janicot (2000) https://doi.org/10.1029/1999GL011285). The strong seasonality observed in the river discharge values of the Volta basin is consistent with the meridional oscillation and natural variability of precipitation distribution over the region. In particular, river discharge  abruptly increases around mid-year, when rainfall gradually migrates northward and falls into the Vola river catchemnt basin. The hydrograph then reaches its annual peaks later in the year, approximatively during boreal autumn, when the cumulative contribution of rainfall across the entire basin is routed through the river network. This peak also coincides with the southward retreat of precipitation, which further enhances runoff generation and sustains high flows. Such a pattern likely reflects both the seasonal migration of the West African Monsoon system and the inherent hydrological response times of the basin. However, the timing and shape of these peaks are not only the result of the natural hydrological variability, but could be also be influenced by the operation of the Akosombo Dam. Reservoir management for hydropower generation (https://www.vra.com/our_mandate/akosombo_hydro_plant.php) tends to dampen short-term variability, sustains baseflow during dry periods, and smooths the hydrograph downstream (Gyau-Boakye (2001) https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1011402116047). 


**Monthly mean river discharge and climatology**

Let's now investigate the mean seasonality of river discharge, by computing the long-term monthly mean of this variable. In the figure below the monthly river discharge climatology is shown at the two locations: in the top panel the estuary, near Ada Foah, and in the bottom panel just downstream of Volta Lake, below the Akosombo Dam. As already mentioned, both series show a very mpronounced annual cycle: the discharge remains relatively low and stable from January to May. Then, from June onward, the streamflow gradually increases, peaking in September-October, before declining again towards December. Between the two locations there are little differences: the timing and shape of the seasonal rise and fall is almost identical; what's differenciate the two locations are the mean discharge values, slightly lower at the upstrem site.

This graph confirms what was hypothesized before: the seasonal pattern closely follows the West African Monsoon rainfall regime. Rainfall starts in the southern basin (April–June), migrates northward in boreal summer (July–August), and retreats south by September–October. The discharge peak may result delayed with respect to rainfall peaks due to basin storage and hydrological routing. Moreover, at the estuary, mean discharge appears to be slightly higher at peak compared to just below the dam, reflecting additional contributions from downstream tributaries downstream the Volta Lake. 


In addition to the long-term climatology, it is here shown the **interannual variability of monthly discharge**. This figure below represents the monthly means for each year between 2010 and 2021 at the two locations, with the overall climatological mean reported for reference. The general seasonal pattern described by the climatology is consistent across all years: flows remain low from January to May, start rising in June and sharply increases into September-October peaks. It can be noted that the magnitude of these peaks varies markedly between years. For example, exceptionally high discharges are evident in September 2018 and October 2019, followed by October 2020. In these occasions, monthly mean river discharge at the estuary reached values of about 12990 m³/s, 9916 m³/s, and 8286 m³/s, respectively. By contrast, years such as 2012, 2013, or 2014 display much more moderate peaks in the order of 4,000–6,000 m³/s. When comparing the two sites, the timing of the rise and fall is almost identical, which suggests that the Akosombo Dam does not alter the overall seasonal rhythm. Its influence is clearer when looking to the difference in the discharge values, even if little: downstream of Lake Volta the curve has peaks slightly dampened compared to the estuary. Meanwhile, flows at the estuary are a little higher at peak, likely because of additional tributaries that join the river downstream of the dam. In general, the interannual variability shown here can be linked to the one of West African Monsoons, depending on both its intensity and the distribution of rainfall across the Volta Basin.
