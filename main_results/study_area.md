# Compound Flooding Characterisation

## Study Area
The geographical focus of this study includes a region in sub-Saharan Africa particularly vulnerable to compound hydrometeorological hazards. The Keta Basin, located in the eastern coast of Ghana within latitudes 5°25′ and 6°20’ North and longitude 0°40′ and 1°10′ East, is one of the pilot sites of the EU-funded ALBATROSS project, which focuses on accelerating climate adaptation in Sub Saharan Africa by co-creating feasible and effective policy recommendations for adaptation together with local and national actors, by integrating climate services and nature-based adaptation strategies. In particular, the Volta Delta is identified in the lower portion of the Volta river basin within the Accra-Ho-Keta Plains (as illustrated by Appeaning Addo 2018, Figure 1).

This low-lying area is severely affected by coastal erosion, sea-level rise, saline water intrusion, and increasing flood risk, having experienced significant shoreline retreat over recent decades, with entire villages displaced and infrastructure lost to the sea. In fact, the Keta Basin is exposed to marine flooding events and coastal storm surges, with the Volta River estuary additionally influencing local hydrodynamics. The relative relevance of the marine and riverine components in the flood risk can be investigated through the characterisation of compound flooding events in the considered area. To carry out such analysis, two points of reference were arbitrarily chosen: the first (0.667°E, 5.77°N), at the Volta river mouth, close to Ada Foah. A second point was picked just downstream the Volta Lake, near to Akosombo (0.087°E, 6.267°N), as a comparative reference for the river discharge component.
