### Water Level

**Water level time series**

The “Maximum Daily Global Open Ocean Water Level” dataset used in this analysis provides a daily time series of offshore maximum water level. The key variable is an open-ocean daily maximum water level signal, whose originary units are 10⁻⁴ m, then converted in m by multiplying by 1e-4. Here, the raw time series of this variable are shown. In particular, the figure shows daily (blue) and corresponding monthly mean (red) water level in meters, at the reference point in the Volta Delta (0.667°E, 5.77°N), near Ada Foah, Ghana. The dataset spans January 2010 through December 2021. The overall water levels fluctuate around 0.03-0.07m, and it is characterized by a daily high-frequency variability, while the monthly average captures the main oscillations and removes high-frequency noise, as an effect of the increased timescale. In particular, daily record contains considerable sub-monthly variance, manifesting as sharp positive and negative excursions around the monthly mean. 
As the dataset is constructed (that is, through satellite altimetry that measures the geophysical sea level anomaly with respect to a reference surface and therefore without the astronomical component), this high sub-seasonal variability of water level may be due to other transient atmospheric and oceanographic forcing.

Moreover, the signal presents a dominant annual cycle, with a seasonal rise and fall in water level: peaks occur twice per year, typically in boreal winter and during early autumn, whereas minima occur in boreal summer. The amplitude of seasonal maxima, however, is not stationary, since their height is far from constant from year to year. In fact, in 2011 and 2019 the daily maxima exceed 0.10-0.12m, while in 2012-2018 they are closer to 0.06-0.08m. 

Over the 12-year record, no systematic trend in mean sea level is detectable. The absence of a clear rising trend is not necessarily inconsistent with global sea-level rise, as the short duration and dominance of interannual variability can mask secular trends. Furthermore, the relative (or local) sea level, that accounts for the changes in sea level experienced at a specific location, depends not only on the global climate-induced sea level rise trend, but also on the eustatic behaviour of the land. Thus, relative sea level change can vary significantly from place to place, even if the global absolute sea level is rising.

**Water Level Climatology**

To better understand the climatological seasonal cycle of sea water level at the Volta river estuary, it is convenient to remove any long-term trend from the signal. Taking the detrended long-term mean of daily water level (blue curve), as well as the monthly detrended mean climatology (red curve) over the period 2010-2021, it becomes even clearer the annual periodicity that this signal exhibits. This seasonal cycle is characterized by maximum values of water levels between February and March, with the highest daily climatology value corresponding to +0.022m on March 19. Levels then decrease steadily through April–July, reaching minimum values in July–August (about –0.025 m on August 4). A recovery phase follows in September–November, with a secondary high plateau (~0 to +0.01 m). Levels decline slightly in December, returning toward neutral values.

Therefore, the water level in the estuarine region of the Volta river, in the Keta Basin (Ghana), shows a variability rango of approximatively 0.03-0.04m. this amplitude is consistent with a climatic signal, not simply noise, and indicates that the estuary is strongly modulated by seasonal oceanographic/atmospheric forcing.

Lastly, the daily climatology (blue) shows considerable intra-month variability, reflecting day-to-day meteorological forcing and high-frequency processes. On the other hand, the monthly mean climatology (red) smooths out these fluctuations and highlights the seasonal structure: one strong annual maximum (in late boreal winter/early spring), a pronounced minimum (boreal summer), and a smaller secondary peak (autumn).

These fluctuations align closely with seasonal wind-driven coastal upwelling and ocean dynamics in the Gulf of Guinea. In fact, the boreal summer is characterized by strengthened southwesterly monsoon winds that induce upwelling: wind-driven divergence of surface waters causes cold, dense subsurface water to rise and replace them, which simultaneously lowers the coastal sea surface height (https://doi.org/10.1016/0079-6611(92)90002-H, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55170-x).

In addition to the seasonal cycle, interannual variability can significantly alter the amplitude of the observed extremes. For instance, the Atlantic Niño/Atlantic Equatorial Mode influences wind stress and sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Guinea, leading to steric changes in sea level and variability in the intensity of coastal upwelling (Tokinaga & Xie, 2011). Such climate modes can explain why some years exhibit stronger seasonal maxima and minima than others, even though the annual cycle remains the dominant pattern.
